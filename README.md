<!-- WIREFRAMES -->


- ### Design

  - Colours

  ---

  - My choice of colours for the page originated from wanting to create a site with a tech feel to it. Each colour gives the page a unqiue blend of vibrant and dark colours in order to achieve that tech theme.

  - Typography

  ---

  - The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the site with Sans Serif as a fallback font. Oswald gives the site a professional feel to it and complements the Lato font used on selected pages.
